            <p>Hooke's law</p>
            <p>In physics, Hooke's law is an empirical law which states that the force (F) needed to extend or compress a spring by some 
                distance (x) scales linearly with respect to that distance and x is small compared to the total possible deformation of the 
                spring. The law is named after 17th-century British physicist Robert Hooke. He first stated the law in 1676 as a Latin 
                anagram. He published the solution of his anagram in 1678 as: ut tensio, sic vis ("as the extension, so the force" or "the 
                extension is proportional to the force"). Hooke states in the 1678 work that he was aware of the law since 1660.</p>

            <p>"Therefore, the seeker after the truth is not one who studies the writings of the ancients and, following his natural disposition, puts his trust 
                in them, but rather the one who suspects his faith in them and questions what he gathers from them, the one who submits to argument and demonstration, 
                and not to the sayings of a human being whose nature is fraught with all kinds of imperfection and deficiency. The duty of the man who investigates 
                the writings of scientists, if learning the truth is his goal, is to make himself an enemy of all that he reads, and ... attack it from every side. 
                He should also suspect himself as he performs his critical examination of it, so that he may avoid falling into either prejudice or leniency."

            <p>Archimedes' principle (also spelled Archimedes's principle) states that the upward buoyant force that is exerted on a body immersed in a fluid, 
                whether fully or partially, is equal to the weight of the fluid that the body displaces. Archimedes' principle is a law of physics fundamental 
                to fluid mechanics. It was formulated by Archimedes of Syracuse.</p>

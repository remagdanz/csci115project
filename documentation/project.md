Lab 8 - Mini Project

- You must give your documents proper names. 
- Put your name as the author of the website at the top of every document you hand in.
- Target about 8 pages of content (minimum 5)
- At least one external CSS stylesheet should be referenced across your website.
- Use meaningful text and include at least 5 images, a list and a table on your website.
- Provide at least two external links to other websites from your project.

- Have a consistent and meaningful layout throughout (e.g., divs, common headers and navigation).
- Aim for a clean and consistent structure (code indents, use folders for stylesheets and images, etc.).

- Each page and stylesheet used passes W3C validation (https://validator.w3.org/ for HTML, https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/ for CSS) without error. (Warning is fine).
- Pass Google's mobile-friendly test (https://www.google.com/webmasters/tools/mobilefriendly/); aim for good responsive web design. You might wish to check this by uploading to your GitHub online space.

- Presentation (short demonstration) of your mini-project.

- The zipped version of the project folder must be submitted to VIULearn under Assignment and into public GitHub space. You share the GitHub link with me. I may ask you to give a 5-min presentation about your project!
- You create your own repository on GitHub, turn that repository into something where you can store your code, and then have that same repository host your website for you.

- Bonus (up to 10% ): Incorporate sophisticated content from the different units of the course, such as proper comments, CSS nav, positioning, flexbox, JavaScript, or other concepts. The more work you put in, the more points you'll earn.
- If there are any special parts of the project or motive/reasons you'd like to bring to my notice, include a readme.txt in that folder as well (e.g., advanced content for me to consider for a bonus).
